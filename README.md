This project has been made for the people that want to create manual pages for their own fonctions, commands or everything else. It is really easy to setup and modify as you want.

SETUP :

cd ~/Documents/

git clone https://github.com/antiyro/man-factory/

mv myman.sh ~/.

cd

source myman.sh

Then you it's done ! You can use the command "myman -new" to create new man pages or open your created man pages with the command myman <the man page name you gave to it>
